# Car Finder

A repository for finding car make, model, and price with purchasing functionality. This project includes two primary APIs: one for vehicle data retrieval and another for shopping cart management.

## Features

- **API 1:** Provides the make, model, and price of vehicles.
- **API 2:** Handles shopping cart functionality for purchasing cars.

## User Story

As a user, I want to search for cars by specific criteria such as make, model, price, and year, compare different vehicles, and purchase a selected vehicle using a shopping cart.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The system should prompt the user for details such as vehicle type, price range, make, model, and year.
- The user should be able to view and compare vehicles in a structured table format.
- Once a car is selected, the user can add it to a shopping cart for purchase.
